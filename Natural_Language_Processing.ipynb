              " 'unfortunately , the excellent schroedter report did not take account of this criterion , despite the fact that there is considerable evidence to show - as we shall see later in the berend report - how , in fact , these funds are providing splendid assistance to the most backward regions in order to bridge the gulf that separates them from europe &apos; s most highly-developed regions .',\n",

              " 'mrs schroedter , you quite rightly pointed out that while it is chiefly up to the member states and the regions to define their own priorities in development matters , european union cofinancing of the programmes requires , and is the justification for , a situation where community priorities as debated and approved in this house should also be taken into account in order to promote this community aspect of economic and social cohesion which many of you forcefully pointed out .',\n",
              " 'so , ladies and gentlemen , i should like in a moment to return to the role and structure of the guidelines before mentioning the principal comments and criticisms that you , mrs schroedter , and the various members of this house , have made .',\n",
              " 'regarding the role and structure of these guidelines , mr hatzidakis , mrs schroedter and mrs mccarthy mentioned that the purpose of these guidelines is to assist national and regional authorities in preparing their programming strategy for each of structural fund objectives 1 , 2 and 3 as well as their links with the cohesion funds .',\n",
              " 'this means putting forward the commission &apos; s priorities , based on past experience in implementing the programmes , as well as current community policies relating to structural operations .',\n",
              " 'the objective is that these priorities should contribute to the better use , to the optimum and efficient use , as some of you have wished , of community involvement , including , mr bradbourn , using , if necessary , the performance reserve which is specifically intended to encourage the optimum and efficient use of european public monies .',\n",
              " 'when i speak of optimum utilisation , i am referring both to the national and regional levels . and so , mr seppänen , i shall also mention at this point , speaking of the national level , the link with the cohesion fund .',\n",
              " 'this is the purpose of these guidelines .',\n",
              " 'regarding their content , as you know , ladies and gentlemen of this house , they are focused on three strategic priorities that your rapporteur pointed out very clearly but , at the same time , very passionately , as i understood her presentation just now .',\n",
              " 'the first priority is to improve the competitiveness of regional economies in order to create , in all sectors , but especially in the private sector , as mr berend said , the maximum number of serious , worthwhile and permanent jobs , the competitiveness of regional economies , all regional economies , and in particular , mr evans , that of wales , but not only of wales .',\n",
              " 'and , because there are a number of you who have just pointed out what appeared to you to be an omission , let me also add the regional economies of the european regions handicapped by their distance from the centre , be they remote regions , island regions or , of course , the most remote regions which are , naturally , the most distant .',\n",
              " 'perhaps i may inform mr ribeiro e castro , who asked me about this , that , as i wrote to the presidents of each of these most remote regions , the commission did indeed request an extension of several weeks before publishing its anticipated report .',\n",
              " 'concerning the most remote regions , it was only quite belatedly that we received the memorandums from the various governments , but this is not necessarily an excuse , just an explanation .',\n",
              " 'we must therefore take these memorandums into consideration and produce an extremely thorough piece of work .',\n",
              " 'i myself took part in a meeting of the most remote regions on 23 november and , within the college , we considered that we would need several more weeks before being able to produce a report that dealt appropriately with the extremely serious problems and lived up to the expectations of these most remote regions . i would thank you for your understanding in this matter .',\n",
              " 'so that is the first priority , the competitiveness of regional economies .',\n",
              " 'the second priority , which several of you have stressed , mr puerta in particular , but there were others , not that i am mentioning them in any order of priority , is the strengthening of social cohesion and of employment , particularly by raising the profile of human resources far more so than in the past .',\n",
              " 'ladies and gentlemen , we now have a european union where the disparities between countries are observed to be less great , proving the effectiveness and worth of the cohesion fund , but where , at the same time , in relation to unemployment - as you wrote , mrs schroedter - an increasing gap exists between the 15 or 20 richest regions and the 15 or 20 poorest or most disadvantaged regions . this is a situation which is , as it should be , unjustifiable and intolerable .',\n",
              " 'as far as i am concerned - taking into account my own concept of the construction of europe and regional development policy in particular - this is a situation which i find unacceptable and i have every intention , as far as possible , with your support , of dedicating all the appropriations for which i am responsible to this improved social , human and territorial cohesion , particularly in order to prevent what i once called in this house a two-speed europe , a europe of wealthy districts but , at the same time , a europe of impoverished areas .',\n",
              " 'in fact , the guidelines take two horizontal principles into account . the first is rural development , and let me say , mrs schroedter , that i am including in rural development the matter of sustainable transport , an issue i have been involved in personally for a long time .',\n",
              " 'i particularly remember the time when i was minister for the environment in my own country . the second principle is that of equal opportunities , particularly for men and women , as well as the european strategy for employment and the context of economic and monetary union .',\n",
              " 'finally , and in order to respond to the concerns which you have expressed in this house , particularly yourself , mrs schroedter , in these guidelines we recall the importance and the definition of integrated strategies , for development or redevelopment , which , of all the priorities , offer the maximum opportunity to synergy , to the measures undertaken and to the establishment of a decentralised partnership .',\n",
              " 'you expressed some concern about what might look like a lack of reference to this partnership , yet there is a clear reference to it on page 5 of the guidelines .',\n",
              " 'however , i do wish to mention - since you have asked me to do so - that , as far as i am concerned , this partnership - and i spent long enough as a regional administrator within my own country to be able to say this most sincerely - is a tool , one used to involve local brainpower , be it in the public sector , in the form of elected representatives , the social and educational sectors , associations , or in the private sector ; a decentralised partnership , and let me mention in this connection , in response to mrs angelilli , the territorial pacts , which are one of the means available to this decentralised partnership .',\n",
              " 'these are the reasons why the guidelines are presented according to thematic priorities , since they must be taken into consideration , under each of the objectives , to different extents in accordance with the specific situations of each of the member states and regions .',\n",

              " 'let me remind you that when the guidelines were adopted by the commission , in the form of a draft in february 1999 , in line with a new procedure intended to make it easier to present comments on this text , my predecessor , mrs wulf-mathies , presented them to parliament immediately .',\n",
              " 'due to the elections to the european parliament taking place around this time , however , parliament was not able to undertake its examination of these guidelines until after the text had been definitively adopted , in july 1999 .',\n",
              " 'here in this chamber , ladies and gentlemen , among you , i wish to assure you that in the negotiations for the programmes which are only just beginning - mr hatzidakis asked me a question about this - as far as member states are concerned , your observations will certainly be taken into consideration .',\n",
              " 'and let me assure you , furthermore , that when the commission adopts the guidelines with what we call the mid-term review in mind , in line with the regulations , then the point of view of this house , as expressed in this report , will also be taken into account .',\n",
              " 'now to the form .',\n",
              " 'on the subject of the role of the guidelines , mrs schroedter , you pointed out that this is the context in which guidelines on a number of european objectives , often very precise ones , should be provided .',\n",
              " 'i shall not list them all , but they include implementing intersectoral policies , increasing efficiency in the use of public funds , assisting the various partners in drawing up regional or national programming together , etc . the commission takes note of these , but several of these guidelines or these questions are related more to other documents , such as the guide to the reform of the structural funds or the methodological working document .',\n",

              " 'i actually quoted the text itself , in quotation marks .',\n",
              " 'moreover , the guidelines may not substitute for the programming or the ex ante assessments which must be the tool used to specify priorities and the effectiveness of these programmes .',\n",

              " 'i find the opposite the case .',\n",
              " 'i wish to confirm the great importance the commission attaches , and shall attach , to the urban dimension of our cohesion policy .',\n",
              " 'indeed , i had occasion recently to say as much to all the ministers responsible for urban policy at a meeting in tampere .',\n",
              " 'as regards rural development , which a number of you brought up , particularly mrs redondo jiménez , the guidelines are in line with the twofold objective mentioned by your rapporteur : a strong agricultural sector linked with increased competitiveness in rural areas , but also protection of the environment and europe &apos; s rural heritage .',\n",
              " 'it must , however , be stressed that the guidelines under discussion are related only to the structural funds , whose objectives 1 and 2 specifically adopt the diversification of rural society as a priority .',\n",
              " 'and indeed , on the subject of the balance of rural society , let us not forget that there is also the new rural development policy cofinanced by the eaggf guarantee section , aimed at promoting reform in european agriculture and supporting the multifunctional aspect of agriculture .',\n",
              " 'at this stage , i would simply like to say that i would like to see it integrated into the programming for objective 2 rural areas , in the way that the eaggf guidance section is for objective 1 regions .',\n",

              " 'in this respect , we should heed the words of von eieck , and doubtless also those of the great italian liberal bruno leoni , who warned precisely against the risks of an abnormal increase in anti-competition policies .',\n",

              " 'there is state aid for businesses - we have already discussed this , there is still a strong public presence in the economy - it is estimated that the italian treasury controls 15 % of stock exchange capitalisation ; governments and central banks place obstacles in the way of mergers and acquisitions ; and there has been much talk in recent weeks about vodafone &apos; s bid for mannesmann and the bailout of holzmann .',\n",
              " 'finally , commissioner , we cannot forget that large sections of the economy are still firmly in the hands of the state , ranging from state television , which is funded on a mandatory basis by the taxpayer , and the post office , to some compulsory insurance schemes , including health and social welfare systems , which are managed by inefficient state monopolies which leave no-one but the wealthy user with any other option .',\n",
              " 'commissioner , i am quite familiar with the constraints imposed by the treaties , but i believe that , it must be emphasised once again that the european economy is finding it hard to compete with the american economy , especially because of insufficiently open markets and a lack of genuine competition .',\n",
              " 'what is being done may well be very important , but it is still not sufficient .',\n",
              " 'mr president , we are holding a special debate : on competition policy and state aid , the government &apos; s right and left hand , so to speak .',\n",
              " 'whilst the emu criteria are forcing member states to curb expenditure , the high level of state aid to industry has so far remained in place .',\n",
